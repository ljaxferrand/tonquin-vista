## Overview

Tonquin Vista Cabin Rentals is a custom WordPress theme with WooCommerce integration for a cabin rental website. As the capstone project for British Columbia Institute of Technology's Front-end Web Developer program, I built this site with three other developers. We worked in a fully remote environment using Slack for communication, Trello for project management, and GitHub for code collaboration. 

The site features accommodation booking calendar and a custom styled Google Map. It is set up fully with Advanced Custom Fields so the site owners can update all content dynamically as needed.

## Summary

### Key Takeaways

WordPress is a powerful open-source CMS with so much potential for customization. Coupled with WooCommerce, it features great tools for businesses to quickly set up and manage their online sales. When building this site, our team of four developers also played the role of client. This helped us see the development process from their perspective and enabled us to build out customization with ACFs and CPTs so they can easily manage the site content after deployment. 

### Roadmap
If I were to continue iterating on this project, I would add some of the following features/optimizations based on feedback received during testing: 

 - [ ] Improve UI/UX of mobile nav menu
 - [ ] Build custom 404 page (remove current plugin)
